# Salesforce Branching Strategy Whitepaper

## Introduction
In Salesforce development, an effective branching strategy is critical to managing the complexity of multiple environments, teams, and release cycles. A well-defined branching strategy ensures smooth progression from Development to Quality Assurance (QA), System Integration Testing (SIT), User Acceptance Testing (UAT), and Production (PROD). This whitepaper outlines best practices for implementing a Git-based branching strategy tailored to Salesforce, leveraging its metadata-driven architecture and deployment needs to enhance collaboration, quality, and stability.

## Why a Branching Strategy Matters in Salesforce
Salesforceâ€™s multitenant, metadata-driven platform requires a structured approach to version control to manage customizations, integrations, and releases. A branching strategy provides:
- **Isolation**: Developers can work on features without impacting others.
- **Traceability**: Changes are tracked across environments.
- **Stability**: Production remains reliable while development progresses.
- **Collaboration**: Teams align across Development, QA, SIT, UAT, and PROD phases.

This document focuses on a Git-based branching strategy, the de facto standard for Salesforce, integrated with Salesforce DX (SFDX) for modern development workflows.

## Salesforce Environments and Their Roles
Salesforce environments (sandboxes and production orgs) align with the software development lifecycle (SDLC):
- **Development (DEV)**: Feature creation and unit testing.
- **Quality Assurance (QA)**: Functional and regression testing.
- **System Integration Testing (SIT)**: Validation of integrations with external systems.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: End-user validation of business requirements.
- **Production (PROD)**: Live environment for end-users.

A branching strategy must map Git branches to these environments to ensure seamless deployments and testing.

## Recommended Branching Strategy: Feature-Based with Environment Alignment

### Core Principles
1. **Single Source of Truth**: The `main` branch reflects the Production environment.
2. **Short-Lived Feature Branches**: Minimize merge conflicts and accelerate feedback loops.
3. **Environment-Specific Branches**: Dedicated branches for QA, SIT, and UAT.
4. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automate testing and deployment to reduce errors.

### Branch Structure
- **`main`**: Represents the Production environment. Only thoroughly tested, UAT-approved changes are merged here.
- **`qa`**: Mirrors the QA sandbox for functional and regression testing.
- **`sit`**: Aligns with the SIT sandbox for integration testing with external systems.
- **`uat`**: Reflects the UAT sandbox for end-user validation.
- **`feature/*`**: Short-lived branches for individual features or bug fixes (e.g., `feature/add-lead-scoring`).
- **`hotfix/*`**: Emergency fixes applied directly to `main` (e.g., `hotfix/fix-login-error`).

### Workflow
1. **Development (DEV)**:
   - Developers create a `feature/*` branch from `main`.
   - Work occurs in a Developer Sandbox or Scratch Org.
   - Unit tests (minimum 75% Apex code coverage) are written and validated.
   - Changes are committed and pushed to the feature branch.
   - A pull request (PR) is submitted to merge into `qa`.

2. **Quality Assurance (QA)**:
   - The `qa` branch is deployed to a QA sandbox via CI tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
   - QA teams perform functional testing, regression testing, and smoke tests.
   - Issues are flagged, and developers iterate on the feature branch.
   - Once approved, the feature branch is merged into `qa`, and `qa` is promoted to `sit`.

3. **System Integration Testing (SIT)**:
   - The `sit` branch is deployed to an SIT sandbox.
   - Integration tests validate connectivity with external systems (e.g., ERP, marketing tools).
   - Automated API and end-to-end tests ensure system interoperability.
   - Upon success, `sit` is merged into `uat`.

4. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**:
   - The `uat` branch is deployed to a UAT sandbox.
   - End-users and stakeholders validate against business requirements.
   - Test scripts simulate real-world scenarios (e.g., lead creation, opportunity closure).
   - Feedback is addressed via updates to the original feature branch, retested in QA/SIT, and promoted back to `uat`.
   - Once approved, `uat` is merged into `main`.

5. **Production (PROD)**:
   - The `main` branch is deployed to Production via a controlled release process.
   - Deployment is preceded by a final validation in a staging sandbox (if available).
   - Post-deployment smoke tests confirm stability.

### Hotfixes
- For urgent Production issues:
  - Create a `hotfix/*` branch from `main`.
  - Apply fixes, test in a sandbox, and merge back into `main`.
  - Propagate the fix to `qa`, `sit`, and `uat` to maintain consistency.

## Best Practices

### 1. Naming Conventions
- Use clear, descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/DEV-123-lead-form`, `hotfix/PROD-456-login-bug`).
- Include ticket IDs (e.g., Jira) for traceability.

### 2. Sandbox Management
- Refresh sandboxes regularly (e.g., post-Production release) to align with `main`.
- Use partial sandboxes for DEV/QA and full sandboxes for SIT/UAT.

### 3. Automation with CI/CD
- Leverage SFDX and CI/CD tools to automate deployments and testing.
- Run Apex unit tests on every PR to `qa`.
- Use tools like Selenium or Provar for automated UI/integration tests in SIT/UAT.

### 4. Code Review and Pull Requests
- Require PR approvals from at least two team members (e.g., developer and QA).
- Include automated checks (e.g., linting, test coverage) in PR pipelines.

### 5. Delta Deployments
- Use SFDX to deploy only changed metadata between environments, reducing deployment time and risk.

### 6. Testing Strategy Alignment
- **DEV**: Focus on unit tests and happy-path scenarios.
- **QA**: Emphasize regression and edge-case testing.
- **SIT**: Prioritize integration and performance testing.
- **UAT**: Validate user workflows and acceptance criteria.

### 7. Governance
- Define release schedules (e.g., bi-weekly) and freeze periods for SIT/UAT.
- Document environment mappings and branch policies in a shared repository.

## Benefits of This Strategy
- **Reduced Conflicts**: Short-lived feature branches minimize merge issues.
- **Improved Quality**: Rigorous testing across QA, SIT, and UAT ensures reliability.
- **Faster Releases**: Automation and clear workflows accelerate delivery.
- **Auditability**: Git history tracks every change from DEV to PROD.

---

## Challenges and Mitigations
- **Challenge**: Sandbox drift (e.g., QA diverging from PROD).  
  **Mitigation**: Schedule regular sandbox refreshes and sync branches with `main`.
- **Challenge**: Complex integrations failing in SIT.  
  **Mitigation**: Mock external systems in DEV/QA and test real integrations in SIT.
- **Challenge**: UAT delays due to user feedback.  
  **Mitigation**: Involve stakeholders early in QA to align expectations.

---

## Tools and Technologies
- **Version Control**: Git (hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code with Salesforce Extensions.
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI.
- **Testing**: Apex Test Framework, Selenium, Provar, or Copado Robotic Testing.
- **Deployment**: Salesforce DX (SFDX) for metadata management.

## Conclusion
A robust Salesforce branching strategy bridges Development, QA, SIT, UAT, and Production, ensuring a predictable and high-quality release process. By aligning Git branches with Salesforce environments, enforcing testing at each stage, and leveraging automation, organizations can achieve faster delivery, fewer defects, and greater user satisfaction. This feature-based approach with environment-specific branches balances agility and stability, making it ideal for Salesforce teams of all sizes.
