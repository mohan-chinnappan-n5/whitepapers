# Understanding LWR-Based Experience Cloud Sites in Salesforce


Salesforce Experience Cloud has evolved with the introduction of **Lightning Web Runtime (LWR)**, a high-performance runtime engine designed to power next-generation digital experiences. LWR-based Experience Cloud sites offer a modern alternative to traditional Aura-based sites, delivering faster load times, improved scalability, and a streamlined development process. This document explores the mechanics of LWR, its advantages, and how it transforms the creation of portals, communities, and websites within Salesforce.

## What is LWR?
Lightning Web Runtime (LWR) is a lightweight, Node.js-based runtime environment built by Salesforce to enhance the performance of Experience Cloud sites. Unlike traditional Experience Cloud sites, which rely on the Aura framework, LWR leverages the **Lightning Web Components (LWC)** standard—a modern, standards-based web framework—combined with a server-side rendering engine. Introduced as part of Salesforce’s push for faster, more efficient digital experiences, LWR powers a new generation of sites optimized for speed and flexibility.

### Key Characteristics
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Pages are pre-rendered on the server, reducing client-side processing.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Supports pre-built static assets for near-instant load times.
- **Lightweight Architecture**: Minimizes JavaScript overhead compared to Aura-based sites.
- **LWC Foundation**: Built entirely on Lightning Web Components, aligning with modern web standards.

## LWR vs. Traditional Aura-Based Sites
Traditional Experience Cloud sites use the Aura framework, which, while robust, can be slower due to its heavier client-side processing and legacy architecture. LWR-based sites mark a significant shift:

| **Aspect**            | **Aura-Based Sites**                  | **LWR-Based Sites**                  |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Framework**         | Aura (older Salesforce framework)     | LWC + LWR (modern web standards)     |
| **Rendering**         | Primarily client-side                | Server-side + static options         |
| **Performance**       | Slower load times (5-10s typical)    | Faster load times (1-3s typical)     |
| **JavaScript Load**   | Higher client-side JS footprint      | Minimal JS, optimized delivery       |
| **SEO**               | Limited (client-side rendering)      | Improved (server-side rendering)     |
| **Customization**     | Broad but complex                    | Focused on LWC, less legacy overhead |

LWR sites are designed for **public-facing experiences** (e.g., marketing sites, support portals) and excel in scenarios requiring speed and scalability, though they currently offer fewer out-of-the-box components than Aura.

## Key Features of LWR-Based Experience Cloud Sites

### 1. Enhanced Performance
- **Details**: LWR uses SSR and SSG to deliver pages quickly, often under 3 seconds, even on complex sites. It minimizes client-side JavaScript, improving First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Time to Interactive (TTI).
- **Benefit**: Ideal for public sites where speed impacts user retention and SEO rankings.

### 2. Build Options
- **Description**: Offers two site types:
  - **Enhanced LWR Sites**: Fully managed by Salesforce, with Experience Builder support for no-code customization.
  - **Microsites**: Lightweight, developer-driven sites with minimal features, built via code (e.g., VS Code).
- **Details**: Enhanced LWR sites include templates like "Build Your Own (LWR)" and support drag-and-drop design, while microsites are code-first for maximum control.
- **Benefit**: Flexibility for both business users and developers.

### 3. Simplified Component Model
- **Description**: Relies exclusively on LWC, with a curated set of lightweight components (e.g., navigation, content blocks).
- **Details**: Fewer standard components than Aura (e.g., no Chatter out-of-the-box), but custom LWC development is encouraged.
- **Benefit**: Cleaner, future-proof codebase with less technical debt.

### 4. SEO and Accessibility
- **Description**: Server-side rendering improves search engine indexing and compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG).
- **Details**: Static HTML output ensures crawlers can read content easily, unlike Aura’s client-side delays.
- **Benefit**: Boosts visibility and inclusivity for public-facing sites.

### 5. Headless Capabilities
- **Description**: Supports decoupled architectures via APIs and static asset generation.
- **Details**: Pair LWR with a custom front-end (e.g., React, Vue) using Salesforce APIs for data.
- **Benefit**: Enables modern development workflows for advanced teams.

## Benefits of LWR-Based Sites
1. **Blazing Fast Load Times**: Reduces bounce rates and improves user satisfaction.
2. **Scalability**: Handles high traffic (e.g., millions of visitors) with minimal latency.
3. **SEO Optimization**: Enhances discoverability on Google and other search engines.
4. **Developer-Friendly**: Aligns with web standards (ES6+, HTML5), easing onboarding for modern developers.
5. **Cost Efficiency**: Faster sites reduce infrastructure strain and support costs.

## Practical Applications

### Use Case 1: Public Support Portal
- **Scenario**: A tech company launches a self-service portal for customers to access FAQs and submit tickets.
- **Implementation**: Using the "Build Your Own (LWR)" template, the team designs a lightweight site with a Knowledge component and a custom LWC for ticketing. SSR ensures quick access.
- **Outcome**: 50% faster page loads, improving customer retention.

### Use Case 2: Marketing Microsite
- **Scenario**: A retailer creates a campaign site for a product launch.
- **Implementation**: Developers build a microsite with LWR, using static generation for landing pages and APIs for dynamic pricing. The site integrates with a custom React front-end.
- **Outcome**: Near-instant load times drive higher conversions.

### Use Case 3: Partner Resource Hub
- **Scenario**: A vendor offers partners a resource portal with guides and updates.
- **Implementation**: An Enhanced LWR site is customized in Experience Builder with audience-targeted pages (e.g., certified vs. non-certified partners).
- **Outcome**: Improved partner engagement with a snappy, branded experience.

## Limitations and Considerations
1. **Fewer Out-of-the-Box Features**: Lacks some Aura components (e.g., Chatter, rich case management) as of March 2025—custom development may be needed.
2. **Public Focus**: Best for external, unauthenticated users; less suited for complex internal communities.
3. **Transition Effort**: Migrating from Aura to LWR requires rebuilding, not a direct upgrade.
4. **Learning Curve**: Teams accustomed to Aura may need to adapt to LWC and LWR workflows.

---

## Best Practices
1. **Evaluate Use Case**: Use LWR for public, performance-critical sites; stick with Aura for feature-rich internal portals.
2. **Optimize Assets**: Minimize images and custom JS to maintain speed gains.
3. **Leverage LWC**: Build custom components early to fill feature gaps.
4. **Test Performance**: Use tools like Lighthouse to benchmark load times pre- and post-launch.
5. **Plan Migration**: For existing sites, pilot LWR with a new project before full transition.

## Conclusion
LWR-based Experience Cloud sites represent Salesforce’s vision for the future of digital experiences—fast, scalable, and aligned with modern web standards. By prioritizing performance and flexibility, LWR empowers businesses to deliver public-facing portals and microsites that meet today’s demands for speed and discoverability. While it’s not a one-size-fits-all replacement for Aura, it’s a game-changer for organizations prioritizing user experience and efficiency. As Salesforce continues to enhance LWR, expect broader feature parity and adoption.
